COLLISION:
Make viruses collide WITH EACH OTHER
Make viruses collide WITH THE LIBRARY WALL (not the actual wall)

VIRUS LIBRARY:
ON CLICK, the current virus should CHANGE TO THE SELECTED
Give each virus some JS properties (i.e. SPEED so we can change them dynamically)
	IDEALLY change to a uniform JSON format which we can read, but if no time its fine
